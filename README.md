Flameduino v1.1
===============

The flameduino is set to drive an ignition coil or coil-pack (coil on plug) for achieving sparks at defined intervals and a set dwell. This can then be used to ignite things (like grills) or, if put in a vehicle's exhaust, a flamethrower. It is designed to incorporate a potentiometer for variable spark frequency (delay period between firing events).

Features
---
The current feature set includes:
 - Variable `dwell` (coil charging dwell, default: 2.5ms)
 - Variable period range between firing events (default: 5ms to 1s)
 - Serial output in `debug` mode
 - Invertable Trigger output (HIGH or LOW)
 - MultiFire (multiple sparks per event, configurable `firingDwell`)
